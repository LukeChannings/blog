# Luke's blog

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance developer that works on Web Apps.

In my spare time I enjoy,

- **Home Automation**, things that matter to me are security, privacy, and offline-first. Using great open-source projects like [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) and [Zigbee2MQTT](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee2mqtt) I can build my own smart home that is air gapped from the internet, doesn't use weak or well-known encryption keys, and does all the same cool stuff. You can build a secure smart home. *Relevant repos*: [home-assistant-config](https://github.com/LukeChannings/home-assistant-config), [node-red-config](https://github.com/LukeChannings/node-red-config)
- ***Ops**, because we all have servers, and running things on those servers should be easy. I like Kubernetes, and I like bare-metal private clusters. *Relevant repos:* [.config](https://github.com/LukeChannings/.config), [kube-config](https://github.com/LukeChannings/kube-config)
- **Coffee**, an interest completely non-technical. But not really, because making the perfect espresso involves balancing pressure, temperature, grind size, distribition and consistency, and precise doses and yields. It was only a matter of time before I broke out the code. *Relevant repos:* [Gesha](https://github.com/LukeChannings/gesha)


I usually use whichever language / framework that are the best tools for whichever job I'm doing, but I'm biased towards JavaScript because that's what I'm most familiar with. I like to keep my data separated from my functions.
